# Introduction to Development

Welcome to Code 201! Today we're going to be reviewing the basics of HTML, CSS, and Javascript, along with getting our systems setup to do professional web development.

## Learning Objectives

### Students will be able to

#### Describe and Define

- HTML
- CSS
- JS
- VSCode
- Command Line Operations
- GitHub

#### Execute

- Create a HTML page from scratch, with proper HTML5 hierarchical structure conventions.
- Include a `<script>` tag in an HTML document that will interact with the user via prompt/alert.
- Write JavaScript that will interact with the user via prompt and alert.
- Use the command line to create and change directories, create and list files, and open files in a text editor and in a web browser.
- Install & use plugins for their text editor, including a JavaScript linter.

## Notes

### Unix & Git

Introduction to core the concepts of file management from the command line and the fundamentals of Git and GitHub.

- `pwd` = present working directory
- `tree`  = shows the file tree of your directory
- `ls`, `ls -la`  = list all the files and folders located in your current directory
- `cd` = change directory
- `mkdir` = make directory
- `touch` = create a new file
- `code`  = open up this file in VSCode
- `mv` = move a file
- `rm` = remove a file
- `cp`  = copy a file

### Set up a JavaScript linter

1. Setup your linter by opening your terminal.
1. Type `cd` to navigate to their home directory.
1. Type `code .eslintrc.json`, which will create a new file called `.eslintrc.json` and open it in VSCode.
1. Paste the contents of the `.eslintrc.json` file, which is located in the root of the class repository.

### Additional VSCode Settings

In the lower left-hand corner of VSCode, click on the gear icon and select "Settings". Use the search functionality to set the following values:

- "editor.tabSize" should be set to 2
- "editor.detectIndentation" should be set to true
- "editor.wordWrap" should be set to "on"

## Today's Notes

- get input
- create output

That's what computers do.

It is helpful to use a validator. Such as this one from W3 schools: [html validator](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input)
